The most interesting file is Groups.xml, which contains a hashed password and a username
```
USER:active.htb\SVC_TGS

Group Policy Preferences:

Group Policy Preferences (GPP) was introduced in Windows Server 2008, and among many other features, allowed administrators to modify users and groups across their network.  
An example use case is where a companyâ€™s gold image had a weak local administrator password,  and administrators wanted to retrospectively set it to something stronger. The defined password was AES-256 encrypted and stored in Groups.xml. However, at some point in 2012 Microsoft published the AES key on MSDN, meaning that passwords set using GPP are now trivial to crack and considered low hanging fruit.

Cracking the hash with the command  ```gpp-decrypt hash_value```
We get the password:  ```GPPstillStandingStrong2k18```
